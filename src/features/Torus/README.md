A first experiment looking into re-implementing a GLSL shader using Skia, based on the original app posted by [@baconbrix](https://x.com/baconbrix/status/1924919835420504339). Links to the original code can be found in that post.

Besides the Skia-specific changes, I only added a rotation matrix and a gesture to control it.

To make things simpler, this example only recreates the torus shader. It was pretty much a 1:1 adaptation, so it works as a good example of how to do this.
