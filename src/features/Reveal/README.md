A cool image transition effect built on top of the amazing [Circular Slider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Va1yBFdUxI&t=47s) component by [Catalin Miron](https://www.youtube.com/@CatalinMironDev/).

I've used a circle SDF to swap between two textures, adding a bit of noise and blur to its edges to make it look more organic. The transition is controlled by either the carousel scroll gesture (swap after momentum ends) or a fling gesture (swap immediately).

All the shaders used in this example, including the transition technique, I've learned in the [GLSL Shaders from Scratch](https://www.simondev.io/courses) course by the incomparable [SimonDev](https://www.simondev.io/). Do check it out!
